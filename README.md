# SP500 Data Exploratory Analysis

As a college student interested in investing, I chose to study the S&P 500's historical data. Inspired by Warren Buffett's advice in 'Guide to Wise Investing' to invest gradually in a broad index, I'm examining whether this strategy proves effective over time.

Market Basics <br>
The stock market consists of various exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. These exchanges connect buyers and sellers, facilitating the trade of stock shares while tracking the supply, demand, and consequently, the stock's price.

Market indexes like the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, measure the performance of certain stock groups. These groups may represent the entire market or specific sectors like technology or retail. These indexes are commonly referenced as indicators of the market's overall health. In this code, I will conduct data exploratory analysis on the S&P 500 index. The CSV file contains data from 2000 to 2022.
